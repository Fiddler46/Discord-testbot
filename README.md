# Standup Bot ðŸ¤–
> Discord bot for Scrum daily standups

## How-To:

#### *Disclaimer:* 

This bot is meant to help with your daily standups & keep a track of tasks accomplished. The bot could be triggered using commands which can be used to update the bot with the scrum(s) for that particular day. The scrums of every team member are stored in a database.

### Initial Setup [required only to run the server]

[Click Here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOTS_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=355408) to add the bot to the discord server. 
> Note that the above requires you to have the **Manage Server** permission in this server  


### Commands

### Usage
> Standup time is set to `10:30:00 PM EST` every weekday

Anytime before the standup time, added members must trigger the bot with the `reply` followed by their message in the projects channel. The bot will then upload this response to the database.    


After the message has been posted, the bot will delete all member responses, thus members will have to DM for the next standup.

#### Backend made with

- `Discord.js` and `node-schedule` for cron jobs
